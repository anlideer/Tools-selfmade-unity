## Dynamic arrow

Follow mouse (updating length and rotation). Or set start and end position in the codes (not the attributes start&end point) and let it updating dynamically. Or set two squares (in the attributes) and let it updating dynamically (starting and ending at the border of the squares). (Maybe need to modify some, depending on the size of the square.)
